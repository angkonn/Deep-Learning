# Kaggle Intro to Deep Learning & Computer Vision

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from two Kaggle courses:  
- **Intro to Deep Learning**  
- **Computer Vision**

These notebooks cover essential concepts in deep learning and computer visionâ€”from building neural networks to exploring convolutional techniques, pooling, and data augmentation for image processing.

## Repository Structure
- **Intro_to_Deep_Learning**: Notebooks covering fundamental deep learning workflows, including network architecture design, activation functions, and model optimization.
- **Computer_Vision**: Notebooks that dive into convolutional neural networks, sliding windows (stride and padding), custom convnets, and techniques to enhance image data.

- You can use the notebooks as a reference for best practices in deep learning and computer vision projects.
